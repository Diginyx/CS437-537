Title: Igunaujannguaq

Igunaujannguaq, an Inuit word which translates to "Frozen Walrus Carcass", is a game which involves a person (the "frozen walrus carcass") in the centre of a ring of people trying to remain stiff as he or she is passed, hand over hand, around the ring. The person who drops the "frozen walrus carcass" then becomes the "frozen walrus carcass" and must be passed around the ring.
