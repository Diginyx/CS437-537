Title: The Funny Side of Christmas: Christmas Trees

"Christmas Trees" is a mini-episode of the BBC sit-com, "Only Fools and Horses". It was first screened on 27 December 1982 as part of "The Funny Side of Christmas", a BBC special in which special mini episodes of "Only Fools and Horses", "Yes Minister", "Last of the Summer Wine", "Butterflies" and "Open All Hours" were broadcast.

Despite knocking the price down to a mere Â£6, Del Boy cannot seem to sell his telescopic Christmas trees. He has only 149 more to sell to make a tidy profit.

Stuck for a solution, the Trotters head off to Sid's burger van for something to eat. Del's conscience seems to get the better of him, and he tells Rodney and Grandad what a shame it is that the market traders cannot afford to donate a tree to the local church this year, especially the little orphans.

Left to guard the trees, Rodney takes one to the church. The vicar quickly debunks Del's story, and Rodney realises the tale was a scam to get an endorsement from the Church of England.
